On the ground research, what are the merchants struggling to get reliably

container draiage? Taking it from the port, to the port

Focusing on local companies on the islands who are regularly managing shippments, where do I struggle the most (ovens, oil, meat, ...)

Meeting people at bars

I would pay the hourly rate, what are the current processes

How to conduct user *Just enough research, erika hall,* quintin on medium, uxrfg.com, designbetter.co
Gorilla research (airbnb initial researchm stripe initial research)
Shipping companies that do provide shipping services (ferry company)

You don’t want to be in the logistics business, what is driving that shipping company crazy 
Maritime laws are old, the more you can minimize, the better

Flexport bought a customs company, license company
Laws on licences

Training

Asset cost and liability, lower the exposure, simplify for yourself, provide services to shipping companies
